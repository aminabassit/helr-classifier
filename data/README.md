# Datasets

## Structure

This repository contains training and testing datasets that are organized as follows:

- Training phase files:
    -  'DATASET_train.csv' contains feature vectors of shape=(n_features, n_samples)
    - 'DATASET_train_IDs.csv' contains the corresponding subjects IDs that are in a consecutive order
    
- Testing phase files:
    - 'DATASET_test.csv' contains feature vectors of shape=(n_features, n_samples)
    - 'DATASET_test_IDs.csv' contains the corresponding subjects IDs that are in a consecutive order

## Public Datasets

The public datasets used for testing the HELR classifier are:

- **BMDB dataset**[1] (DS2 of BMDB  only genuine signatures are considered and skilled forgeries are not) for Dynamic Signatures. The features were extracted by the
algorithm described in [2].

- **PUT dataset**[3] for faces. The initial features were extracted by the VGGFace [4], the first layersâ€™ weights were taken from [5] and the last layer was retrained for PUT to learn a projection from the 4096-dimensional last layer's output of the pre-trained model to a 64-dimensional latent space. Further details can be found in [6].

- **FRGC2.0 dataset**[7] (Experiment 1, mask II) for faces. The features were extracted by VGGFace[4].

- **CelebA dataset**[8] for faces. The features were extracted by VGGFace[4].
